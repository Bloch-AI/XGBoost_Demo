# XGBoost Financial Prediction Demo

Supporting notebook for the Medium Article XGBoost Explained: A Beginner's Guide

This script demonstrates the application of the XGBoost classifier for a financial prediction task, specifically predicting whether a stock's closing price will be higher or lower than its opening price based on simulated historical data. The process encompasses data generation, preprocessing, model training with hyperparameter tuning, evaluation, and interpretation, providing a comprehensive overview of a machine learning pipeline.

## Features

- Synthetic stock data generation with added noise to simulate real-world unpredictability in stock movements

- Feature engineering, including daily price changes, volume changes, and temporal features

- Data preprocessing using StandardScaler for feature scaling

- XGBoost classifier with hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV and cross-validation

- Comprehensive model evaluation using various metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC-AUC, log loss, Matthews correlation coefficient)

- Informative visualisations, including feature importance plot, confusion matrix, ROC curve, and Precision-Recall curve

- Model interpretation using SHAP values for explainable AI (XAI)

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

- pandas

- numpy

- matplotlib

- seaborn

- xgboost

- scikit-learn

- shap

## Usage

1. Install the required libraries:
   ```
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn xgboost scikit-learn shap
   ```

2. The script will generate synthetic stock data, preprocess the data, train an XGBoost classifier with hyperparameter tuning, evaluate the model's performance, and display various visualisations and interpretation results.

## Suggested Improvements

1. Use real historical stock data or more advanced simulation techniques to generate more realistic data for training and testing the model.

2. Explore additional domain-specific features or use more advanced techniques like technical indicators or sentiment analysis to improve the model's predictive power.

3. Experiment with other machine learning models, such as Random Forest, LightGBM, or deep learning models, to compare their performance and robustness.

4. Implement backtesting techniques, such as walk-forward validation or rolling window analysis, to assess the model's performance on historical data and its effectiveness over time.

5. Optimise the hyperparameter tuning process by using more advanced techniques like Bayesian optimisation or genetic algorithms to efficiently search the hyperparameter space.

6. Investigate the use of imbalanced learning techniques, such as oversampling, undersampling, or class weights, to handle potential class imbalance in the target variable.

7. Expand the model interpretation section by including additional SHAP visualisations, such as dependence plots or force plots, to provide deeper insights into the model's behaviour and feature interactions.
